<h2>
Did someone say pizza?</h2>

<p>Pizza first originated from Italy, but since then, Americans and many other countries have adopted pizza as its own and changed it to suit their tastes. How could anyone not like pizza? There are so many different variations to it that it's hard not to like it! You can have super unhealthy, carb loaded pies or there are the extremely healthy (especially if it's made from scratch), vegan/vegetarian options (though not all vegan and vegetarian pizza is healthy). Did we mention that there's dessert pizza?! Yes, pizza can come in all different of forms, even mini muffin sizes. And, of course, who can forget pizza rolls?! Now of course we don't want to seem too biased, but, pizza rocks! The choices are endless.</p>
