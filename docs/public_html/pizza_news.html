<h2>Pizza and Body Language?</h2>

<h2>Highway Pizza Havoc</h2>
<p>In an article by <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/truck-full-frozen-pizza-crashes-shuts-arkansas-highway-article-1.3398989">Daily News</a>, a truck carrying thousands of frozen pizzas, crashed and spilled loads of the pies on the highway, causing the Arkansas highway to shut down.
