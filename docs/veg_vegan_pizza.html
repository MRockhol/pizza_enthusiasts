    <li>French Bread Pizza</li>
    <li>Dessert Pizza</li>
</ol>
<h1>Vegan Options</h1>
<p>Vegans can't always eat what vegetarians do, so of course we would like to list some of the popular vegan options.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Cauliflower Crust Pizza with Black Mung Bean Curry</li>
    <li>Raw Vegan Pizza with Spinach Pesto and Marinated Vegetables</li>
